1. I have always had an interest in coding done a little in the past. What got me interested was my brother, he is a software dev for Apple and has showed me a little bit of coding. Started a small spark. With my major being Marketing I thought it would be good to look a little more into coding with the world is evolving. Plus this class is double dipper.

 2. Be more confident with coding.

 3. A useful tool.

 4. To be able to look at a wedsite differntly.
