Question 1: In general they all do the same with some exceptions. ID is best for specific actions for certain parts of your html and elements. Using class selectors makes everything cleaner and easier. I think it is the better kind to us since it can faster to have one list command multiple elements.

Question 2: I chose a White background with pink(#FF377B), green(#7DE522) and yellow(#FBE608) for my box colors and black for the words to keep everything clean.
