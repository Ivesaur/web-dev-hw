Question 1 and 2: I learned everything from you. This entire semester has been amazing form me simply because of this class. Form learning the basics of HTML, CSS, color code, basic web design, everything has been new and incredible to learn. Github and the online media help where we learned how to use everything was awesome. I really enjoyed this class more then I expected.

Thank you for the help I really appreciated everything.
