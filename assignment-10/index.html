  <h1>Internet Disaster</h1>
  <h2>My own peice I wrote last semester for BMIS</h2>

  <div class="text">
    <p>Aggression and destruction can be found in every human. It is a basic building block of ones personality along with other emotions and tendencies. When some becomes destructive, they are most likely angry. Anger can lead to security flaws being exploited in something as simple as our day to day life’s.
As individuals we pump a lot of money into the internet and all it takes is for someone bored and angry with people to a produce basic virus. One of the best outlets is social media and video games, easily connecting the whole world to one person. By using basic scams through promotion on social media it makes it easy to get some to click a link and destroy their social life. It’s not hard to convince someone or exploit an individual’s curiosity and there aren’t many easy was to prevent a virus or hacker from taking everything. Most good virus protection software only works half the time and is very cheap. The internet is so vast and makes it easily exploited.</p>

<p>The internet will never be perfectly secure, but it could be ten times better then what it is today. Look at what Lphot says, it’s because companies do not want to put the same amount of money into security as they do software development. The internet isn’t a security disaster because of low grade security software, it’s because large corporations realize they can get make more money through make faster not safer products. It comes down to basic politics and marketing. What fuels a company more, constant new products ready for purchase or waiting time one and money on security upgrades.</p>

<p>From a technical stand point security should be just as good as faster software. Just like everything in this world it comes down to money. Our tech is incredibly fast, but even more fragile. Most of our tech is being run on a global network decade old and cause the main issue for our insecurity. It would cost a large amount to make network upgrades and even to make efficient ones which work
Aggression and destruction are characteristics found in everyone. Our global network is out of date and makes it easy for one frustrated person to create destructive virus. Gullible and curious people can become easily affected by just how insecure the internet really is. Through politics, social media and low-grade tech the internet is a security disaster. It’s one of the best outlets or business and making a face for yourself but has more holes in it then swiss cheese.</p>
