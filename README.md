Question 1: My client is new small business just starting out. They asked for a main, about, contact, careers, media, and service page. With these pages to show they what all I can do for them in terms of web design so I can present it to them first.

Question 2: The main difference is the element display:inline ignores the what setting you put for width and height. But an element with display:inline-block does not ignore height and width so you can set width and height at what you want and it will fallow. display:block element will occupy 100% of the width and start from a brand new line.
